Approach for Project 3
-EDA
	Visualise
	Perform Analysis
	Impute when Necessary
-Model 1
	Make assumptions and select fixed features
	Get the dummy variables
	Feature Selection
		KBest (f_classif, chi2)
		RFECV
		Lasso
		Compare
	Build Model (MLR) and plot residuals

-Model 2
	from Model 1, determine renovatable features
	Get the dummary variables
	Feature Selection
		same as Model 1
	Build Model (MLR) and plot residuals
	Compare the coefficients to model 1
	Explain the variance with model 1

Bonus
	for now see if Random Forest can work
	check the Bias vs Variance
